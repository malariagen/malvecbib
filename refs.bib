An overview of the types and number of both RNA-mediated and DNA-mediated TEs that are found in mosquito genomes is presented. A number of novel and interesting TEs from these species are discussed in more detail. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of mosquito genome evolution and for future modifications of natural mosquito populations through the use of TE-mediated genetic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
