@article{Fouet2018,
abstract = {One of the most common strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases relies on the use of chemical pesticides to repel or kill the mosquito vector. Pesticide exposure interferes with several key biological functions in the mosquito and triggers a variety of adaptive responses whose underlying mechanisms are only partially elucidated. The availability of reference genome sequences opens up the possibility of tracking signatures of evolutionary changes, including the most recent, across the genomes of many vector species. In this review, we highlight the recent genomic changes, which contribute to the fascinating adaptation of malaria vectors of the sub-Saharan African region to intensive insecticide-based interventions. We emphasize the operational significance of detailed genomic knowledge for current monitoring and decision-making.},

@article{Fouet2020,
abstract = {Background: New active ingredients, mostly repurposed from the agricultural sector, are gradually being introduced into malaria vector control programs. Prior to scaling up novel insecticides, it is vital to assess if their use in agriculture has already selected mosquito populations with reduced susceptibility in some areas. The aim of the present study was to determine if the use of neonicotinoids in agricultural pest management could drive resistance to clothianidin - a neonicotinoid recently prequalified by WHO for indoor residual spraying. Methods: We carried out intensive sampling of Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii and Culex sp. larvae from a large suburban farm and from 4 surrounding locations belonging to the rural and urban ecosystems of Yaounde, Cameroon. Using WHO tube tests and CDC bottle bioassays, we tested the recommended diagnostic doses of clothianidin against field-collected populations using two laboratory strains as susceptible controls. We exposed adult mosquitoes to the insecticide for 1 h and monitored mortality rates for seven consecutive days. Results: An. coluzzii and Culex sp. mosquitoes were fully susceptible to clothianidin reaching 100{\%} mortality by day 3. By contrast, An. gambiae populations revealed heterogeneous profiles ranging from susceptibility to strong resistance. Populations from the suburban farm, where neonicotinoids are routinely used, displayed the lowest mortality rate (46.5 {\%} ± 5.65) and were capable of surviving 5X and 10X the diagnostic dose of clothianidin. When clothianidin was tested in combination with the synergist piperonyl butoxide, mortality of resistant populations increased from 46.5 {\%} to 92.7 {\%} implying that Cytochrome P450 enzymes play an integral role in the genetic mechanism underlying clothianidin resistance in An. gambiae. Conclusions: These findings show that small clusters of resistance to clothianidin may exist around farmlands where agricultural neonicotinoids are being used. Patches of intensive agriculture should be particularly monitored in indoor residual spraying target areas. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Hemingway2016,
abstract = {World Malaria Day 2015 highlighted the progress made in the development of new methods of prevention (vaccines and insecticides) and treatment (single dose drugs) of the disease. However, increasing drug and insecticide resistance threatens the successes made with existing methods. Insecticide resistance has decreased the efficacy of the most commonly used insecticide class of pyrethroids. This decreased efficacy has increased mosquito survival, which is a prelude to rising incidence of malaria and fatalities. Despite intensive research efforts, new insecticides will not reach the market for at least 5 years. Elimination of malaria is not possible without effective mosquito control. Therefore, to combat the threat of resistance, key stakeholders need to rapidly embrace a multifaceted approach including a reduction in the cost of bringing new resistance management methods to market and the streamlining of associated development, policy, and implementation pathways to counter this looming public health catastrophe.},
